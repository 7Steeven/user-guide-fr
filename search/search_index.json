Its goal is to provide users with a simple yet powerful way to draw and manipulate images on Linux, Mac, and Windows. Originally created and maintained by Jonathan Pobst, until version 1.0, a new community has taken the reins to fly this program to the heights of Paint.Net and beyond! Pinta is a bitmap image editor with many features typical of image editing software including drawing tools, image filters and colour adjustment tools. The focus on usability is reflected in several of the main features of the program: Unlimited undo history. Multiple language support. Flexible toolbar arrangement, including floating as windows or docking around the image edge. Unlike some simple image editing software, Pinta also features support for image layers. About \u00b6 Project History \u00b6 Development of Pinta began in February 2010 and was driven by Jonathan Pobst, then working at Novell. In September 2011 Pobst announced that he was no longer interested in developing Pinta. A new group of developers continued the project. Pinta is written in C# and uses the GTK+ toolkit and the cairo library. The code adjustment and effect filters, originally came from Paint.NET but otherwise the project is original code. Help \u00b6 Contribute \u00b6 If you are interested in contributing to the core of Pinta, like to fix a bug or tweak existing code, you'll want to make your changes available as pull requests on GitHub. Using Git is an important part of contributing to Pinta, so if you want to read up on this we recommend reading the excellent documentation on GitHub, or if you want an even deeper understanding read Pro Git . The source code for Pinta development is available on PintaProject GitHub . Fixing a Bug \u00b6 If you plan to work on a bug that has been registered on our Launchpad page , then go to the relevant bug and make sure no one else is already working on it, then leave a comment saying that you are working on it. Creating a Pinta Fork \u00b6 First you need to make yourself an account with GitHub if you haven't already got one. It is recommended that you use your full name, because we need something to put in the credits! Then you fork the PintaProject Repository , and pull the code down to your local machine. (All explained here .) Writing, Compiling and Testing \u00b6 This is where the magic happens! Make whatever changes are necessary to the source code, but please do not attempt to clean up existing code. We are only interested in seeing functional changes to the code, if they are mixed with cosmetic changes it becomes very difficult to see what has actually changed. Build your code according to the building instructions , and test it to make sure it does what it's supposed to and doesn't do anything it's not supposed to. Committing your Fix \u00b6 When you are satisfied that you have a great fix to share with the world, commit it to your GitHub fork. (See the second part of Create A Repo .) Make sure that the commit message includes the bug number and a short description, this is vital so that the developers know what exactly they are looking at. Then it will be publicly visible for scrutiny, which comes in handy for the next step. Sending a GitHub Pull Request \u00b6 Pull requests are thoroughly explained here . You will want to send a pull request to the Pinta repository from your fork. When the developers see your request, they will test your solution and if it is good they will merge it into the Pinta source code. They will then close the bug on Launchpad and add your name to the credits as a contributor, and you get a lovely warm feeling inside from helping make the world a better place! Translation \u00b6 Another way to contribute to Pinta without writing a line of code is to translate Pinta into a new language. This is all done through a web page, so all you need to know is a second language. Pinta Translation Page Report Bugs & Feature Requests \u00b6 One way to contribute to Pinta without writing code is to file bugs when things don't work. Bug reports let developers know what needs to be fixed in Pinta. If you have a great idea for a new feature for Pinta, we've got a place where you can submit your ideas and vote on which ones should be implemented.

The concepts presented here are explained in much greater depth within the user guide. Everything mentioned here is easily located in the side-navigation for more specific descriptions and examples. Image \u00b6 Images are the basic structure used by Pinta. Roughly speaking, an \u201cimage\u201d corresponds to a single file, such as a PNG or JPEG file. You can also think of an image as corresponding to a single display window. It is not possible to have a single window display more than one image or for an image to have no window displaying it. Instead of thinking of it as a sheet of paper with a picture on it, think of it as more like a stack of papers, or in our case, a stack of \u201clayers\u201d. Layers \u00b6 Pinta uses layers to create a composite image. Think of layers as a stack of transparent papers. Each individual slide can contain a seperate element which will form part of the overall image. The stacked layers in Pinta are organized as if they are viewed from above. Therefore, the arrangement or order of the layers in the Layers Window is important. An opaque image on a layer higher up the stack will block or obscure the image or images in the layers lower in the stack. You can draw on each paper, but still see the content of the other sheets through the transparent areas. Intermediate users often deal with images containing many layers. Layers do not need to be opaque, and they do not cover the entire extent of an image, so when you look at an image's display, you may see more than just the top layer: you may see elements of many layers. Selection \u00b6 When modifying an image, you only want a part of the image to be affected. The \u201cselection\u201d mechanism makes this possible. Each image has its own selection, which you normally see as a moving dashed line separating the selected parts from the unselected parts. As with the idea of images, selections are done by layers to manipulate selected objects or areas. A large component of learning how to use Pinta effectively is acquiring the art of making good selections \u2014 selections that contain exactly what you need and nothing more. Because selection-handling is so centrally important, you can treat the selection tool as though it were a channel for color, placement, sizing, cloning, etc.","title":"Basic Concepts"},{"location":"concept/#basic-concepts","text":"This section provides a brief introduction to the basic concepts and terminology used in Pinta.

The commands that have three dots ... will have a dialog box that offer additional features. This menu is used in conjunction with the Images Window. Layers - contains commands that only affect the active layer. That is the layer selected or highlighted in the Layers Window. It also has a Layers Properties command that can manipulate the type of layer its going to hold. Adjustments - contains commands which modify the colorization of pixels in an image. Each of the default photo editing adjustments in the menu have associated keyboard shortcuts. Effects - contains commands which apply special effects to a selection within an image or to an entire active layer. These commands are found within one of seven sub-menus. The default seven sub-menus that make up the Effects menu are: Artistic, Blurs, Distort, Noise, Photo, Render, and Stylize. Add-ins - will allow you to install more effects, adjustments, and tools via the Add-in Manager. The Add-In Manager provides an easy way to manage any plugins or extensions you might have installed. Window - has two options or commands. They are Save All ( Ctrl + Alt + A ) and Close All ( Shift + Ctrl + W ). Below those features you'll notice an image name for each image that you currently have open. A dot will be displayed to the left of the active image.

Save - command allows you to save the image with the current filename. Cut - command allows you to remove a selected portion of the active layer and place it on the clipboard. (A clipboard is a temporary storage area for data that the user wants to copy from one place to another.) Copy - command copies the selected region to the clipboard. Unlike the Cut command, the Copy command leaves the selection on the active layer. The current selection also remains active in the active window. Paste - command allows you to insert an image or selected section of an image from the clipboard into the active image. Undo - command allows you to erase the last change done to an image, reverting it to an older state. Notice the History Pane when you click on the Undo command. The selected item moves up the list to the previous item. Redo - command allows you to reverse your last Undo. Notice the History Pane when you click on the Redo command. The selected item moves down the list to the next item. So, the Redo command restores any actions that have been previously undone using an Undo. Crop to Selection - command is only available to a selected part of an image. To see how this feature works, click the Rectangle Select button on the Tool Palette and then select an object in your image. Deselect All - command forces all selected pixels to be deselected. After you invoke this command, you'll have no pixels in the active window selected. Zoom - command gives it the appearance of magnifying it or moving away from the image. You can use the drop-down menu to select a specific percentage zoom setting. Cursor Indicator - to show pixel coordinates where the computer cursor is located on the image. Selection Indicator - to show pixel area of the selection. Tools Menu Features \u00b6 Rectangle Select - used to select portions of the picture. This tool selects rectangle sections only. When a portion of a picture is selected tools that are used will only work in the selected area. If a square selection is needed hold the shift key when selecting the area, this will make a square selection. Lasso Select - used to hand select which sections of the image you want selected. This is done by selecting this tool and the drawing around the portion of the image you want selected while holding down the left mouse button. Ellipse Select - works in much the same way as the Rectangle Select except it select elliptical sections (like the rectangle tool if you hold shift down it will select a circle region instead of an ellipse). Magic Wand Select - used to select sections of the image that are similar. This tool can be adjusted to grab more or less of the image that resembles where it was used. Paint Bucket - used to fill areas of similar color with another solid color. Paint Brush - used to free hand markings on the image. These markings can be made in the selected color and in a verity of sizes. Pencil - used to make free hand markings that are 1 pixel in size. Clone Stamp - used to select a section of the picture that will be replicated into another section. This can be useful for eliminating troublesome sections that has multiple colors, patters, or textures as it will replicate those section as place them in the image. Text - used to add text to the image. This tool has the options to change the font with any font loaded on your computer as well as the font color. Rectangle - used to create rectangles that can be either outlines, or filled shapes. If you hold Shift down, it will select a square region instead of a rectangle. Ellipse - used to create elliptical shapes that can be either outlines, or filled shape. Like the rectangle tool if you hold Shift down, it will select a circle region instead of an ellipse Move Selected Pixels - used to move, rotate and scale a selected section of the photo, or to move layers of the image made in Pinta. Move Selection - used to modify the size, rotation, and scale of what you are selecting. For example if you used to Rectangle Selection and made the rectangle too small for the area you wanted to select you can use this tool to resize and move the selection to where you want it to be. Zoom - used to view the image being worked on more closely. After selecting this tool click on the section of the image you wish to view more closely. Pan - used to move around in the image when the image is larger than the screen. To use this tool click in an area (the best area to select is somewhere in the middle of the picture) then hold down the left mouse button and move the cursor. The image will move as if you grabbed the image where you clicked and pushed or pulled the image in the direction that you moved the cursor. Gradient - used to gradients in colors as well as image fading between images. Eraser - used to remove parts of an image or layer. When used on an image, or bottom layer it will leave a transparent background. When used on a layer other than the bottom one this will leave a hole in the layer that will show the underlying layer. Color Picker - used to select a color from the image you are working on. Recolor - used to replace the one color with another. Line/Curve - used to create either straight or curved lines. In the options toolbar (located under the menu bar, is a selection for adding arrows to the begging or end of the line being created. Rounded Rectangle - is similar to the rectangle tool except it creates rectangles with rounded corners. If you hold Shift down, it will select a square region instead of a rectangle. Freeform Shape - used to create irregular shapes that can be either outlines, or filled shape.","title":"General Overview"},{"location":"overview/#general-overview","text":"When the Pinta workspace first loads, you'll notice it has an uncluttered layout that is similar to MS Paint, but has more advanced features compared to it.","title":"General Overview"},{"location":"overview/#pinta-workspace","text":"Menu Bar - at the top, below the Title bar, contains drop-down menus.

Add-ins - will allow you to install more effects, adjustments, and tools via the Add-in Manager. The Add-In Manager provides an easy way to manage any plugins or extensions you might have installed. Window - has two options or commands. They are Save All ( Ctrl + Alt + A ) and Close All ( Shift + Ctrl + W ). Below those features you'll notice an image name for each image that you currently have open. A dot will be displayed to the left of the active image. You can switch between images using the short cut keys Alt + 1 for image one, Alt + 2 for image two, Alt + 3 for image three, and etc. The image names listed in the Window menu will be the same names that is listed in the Images Window. Help - provides quick access to a number of online resources like the Pinta Website, File a Bug, Translate This Application, and About.","title":"Menu Bar Features"},{"location":"overview/#toolbar-features","text":"New - command allows you to create a new, blank, single layered image. Open - command allows you to open an existing image for editing. Save - command allows you to save the image with the current filename. Cut - command allows you to remove a selected portion of the active layer and place it on the clipboard. (A clipboard is a temporary storage area for data that the user wants to copy from one place to another.) Copy - command copies the selected region to the clipboard. Unlike the Cut command, the Copy command leaves the selection on the active layer. The current selection also remains active in the active window. Paste - command allows you to insert an image or selected section of an image from the clipboard into the active image. Undo - command allows you to erase the last change done to an image, reverting it to an older state. Notice the History Pane when you click on the Undo command. The selected item moves up the list to the previous item. Redo - command allows you to reverse your last Undo. Notice the History Pane when you click on the Redo command. The selected item moves down the list to the next item. So, the Redo command restores any actions that have been previously undone using an Undo. Crop to Selection - command is only available to a selected part of an image. To see how this feature works, click the Rectangle Select button on the Tool Palette and then select an object in your image. Deselect All - command forces all selected pixels to be deselected. After you invoke this command, you'll have no pixels in the active window selected. Zoom - command gives it the appearance of magnifying it or moving away from the image. You can use the drop-down menu to select a specific percentage zoom setting. Cursor Indicator - to show pixel coordinates where the computer cursor is located on the image. Selection Indicator - to show pixel area of the selection.","title":"Toolbar Features"},{"location":"overview/#tools-menu-features","text":"Rectangle Select - used to select portions of the picture. This tool selects rectangle sections only. When a portion of a picture is selected tools that are used will only work in the selected area. If a square selection is needed hold the shift key when selecting the area, this will make a square selection. Lasso Select - used to hand select which sections of the image you want selected. This is done by selecting this tool and the drawing around the portion of the image you want selected while holding down the left mouse button. Ellipse Select - works in much the same way as the Rectangle Select except it select elliptical sections (like the rectangle tool if you hold shift down it will select a circle region instead of an ellipse). Magic Wand Select - used to select sections of the image that are similar. This tool can be adjusted to grab more or less of the image that resembles where it was used. Paint Bucket - used to fill areas of similar color with another solid color. Paint Brush - used to free hand markings on the image. These markings can be made in the selected color and in a verity of sizes. Pencil - used to make free hand markings that are 1 pixel in size. Clone Stamp - used to select a section of the picture that will be replicated into another section. This can be useful for eliminating troublesome sections that has multiple colors, patters, or textures as it will replicate those section as place them in the image. Text - used to add text to the image. This tool has the options to change the font with any font loaded on your computer as well as the font color. Rectangle - used to create rectangles that can be either outlines, or filled shapes. If you hold Shift down, it will select a square region instead of a rectangle. Ellipse - used to create elliptical shapes that can be either outlines, or filled shape. Like the rectangle tool if you hold Shift down, it will select a circle region instead of an ellipse Move Selected Pixels - used to move, rotate and scale a selected section of the photo, or to move layers of the image made in Pinta. Move Selection - used to modify the size, rotation, and scale of what you are selecting. For example if you used to Rectangle Selection and made the rectangle too small for the area you wanted to select you can use this tool to resize and move the selection to where you want it to be. Zoom - used to view the image being worked on more closely. After selecting this tool click on the section of the image you wish to view more closely. Pan - used to move around in the image when the image is larger than the screen. To use this tool click in an area (the best area to select is somewhere in the middle of the picture) then hold down the left mouse button and move the cursor. The image will move as if you grabbed the image where you clicked and pushed or pulled the image in the direction that you moved the cursor. Gradient - used to gradients in colors as well as image fading between images. Eraser - used to remove parts of an image or layer. When used on an image, or bottom layer it will leave a transparent background. When used on a layer other than the bottom one this will leave a hole in the layer that will show the underlying layer. Color Picker - used to select a color from the image you are working on. Recolor - used to replace the one color with another. Line/Curve - used to create either straight or curved lines. In the options toolbar (located under the menu bar, is a selection for adding arrows to the begging or end of the line being created. Rounded Rectangle - is similar to the rectangle tool except it creates rectangles with rounded corners. If you hold Shift down, it will select a square region instead of a rectangle. Freeform Shape - used to create irregular shapes that can be either outlines, or filled shape.","title":"Tools Menu Features"},{"location":"palette/","text":"","title":"Creating Palette"},{"location":"posterize/","text":"Posterize \u00b6 The Posterize adjustment reduces the number of color values that each pixel uses, giving the image a \u201cposterized\u201d effect.

Blend Modes: | Name | Description | |-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Multiply | Each pixel's RGB component intensity is multiplied with the pixel value from the composition. The result of this blend mode is always darker than the original. White pixels in the blend layer are effectively rendered transparent by the Multiply blend. | Normal |This is the default and standard blend mode. Each pixel in the layer is blended with the composition depending on its alpha value. | Additive | Each pixel's RGB component intensity is added to the intensity of the pixel values from the composition. The Additive blend has the effect of brightening pixels in the final composition. Black pixels in the blend layer are rendered as transparent by the Additive blend. | | Color Burn | This blend mode has the effect of making dark pixels darker while lighter pixels must be blended with other light colored pixels in order to remain bright. | | Color Dodge | This can be thought of as the opposite of Color Burn. Lighter pixels retain their brightness while darker pixels must be blended with other dark pixels in order to remain dark. | | Reflect | This blend mode can be used for adding shiny objects or areas of light. Black pixels in the blend layer are ignored as if they were transparent. | | Glow | This is the reverse of the Reflect mode: it works the same as swapping the layer positions and using Reflect. Glow effectively brightens the composition by the amount of brightness in the blend layer. Black pixels in the blend layer are rendered as if they were transparent. | | Overlay | This is a combination of Screen and Multiply modes which uses the blend pixel intensity to determine the result. For darker colors, this acts like Multiply. For lighter colors, this acts like Screen. | | Difference | The counterpart to Additive blending. The layer pixel's intensity is subtracted from the composition pixel's intensity resulting in darker colors. Subtraction could produce a negative intensity which is unable to be displayed, so an absolute value is returned. Thus, both \"white minus black\" and \"black minus white\" will both produce white. Difference blend is often useful when using the Clouds effect. | | Negation | At first glance this seems similar to Difference, however it actually produces the opposite effect. Instead of making colors darker, it will make them brighter. | | Lighten | The lightest pixel of either the blend layer or the composition is used. | | Darken | The darkest pixel of either the blend layer or the composition is used. | | Screen | This can be thought of as the opposite of the Multiply blend mode. It is used to make pixels brighter, with black being effectively transparent. | | Xor | This is short for \"exclusive OR\", which is an advanced blending mode that is primarily used for image analysis. Pixels in the blend layer which exactly match the composition will be rendered black. Where differences exist, colors are shown. | The Reseed button randomizes the cloud pattern.

If you have trouble setting up or understanding how to start, please click here for a quick workspace guide. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a final image by using these key ingredients and techniques: Working with layers; Making selections; Sketching and painting; Working with color; Adding text and shapes; And utilizing various common tools. By the end of this tutorial, we will create this little secret burger: Although this is a tutorial on creating an image, this is not a drawing tutorial so we cannot guarantee if your drawing will look exactly as our image. To keep the images consistent, we'll be drawing a very basic burger. It should have at least a top bun, a bottom bun, cheese, a patty, tomatoes and lettuce. Sketching \u00b6 The tools we'll use for sketching are: - Pencil - Eraser - Lasso Select - Shapes - Lines - Text Now we can get started on sketching our little secret burger! Select Layer 2 in the Layers Window. Make sure the Background layer is below the new layer. Double-click the layer to open the Layer Properties. Rename the layer to \"Sketch\". Click OK to close the window. Select \"Sketch\" to make it an active layer. Use the Pencil tool to start drawing your burger. Use the Eraser tool to remove any markings not needed. Change the Eraser size as needed in the Tools Settings Bar. Use any selection tool to move any sketches around. In this case, we used the Lasso Select tool to move the text box up higher. Use the Shapes, Lines and Text tools to help create your sketch if that is your preference, but for this tutorial, we chose to use the pencil. You can also upload a hand-drawn sketch as well too. Go to Setting Up Workspace to learn more. Save your progress and it should look like this: Before we move on to inking the sketch, we want to change the color of the pencil sketch so that it's easier to see between the (black) inking and the (black) sketch itself. Blue would be a nice color to see through, but you're welcome to use whichever color you prefer. Create a layer in the Layers Window. Make sure this new layer is above layer \"Sketch\". Double-click the layer to open the Layer Properties. Rename the layer to \"Color Sketch\". Select \"Color Burn\" under the Blend Mode drop-down. Click OK to close the window. Select \"Color Burn\" to make it an active layer. Click on the Paint Bucket and left-click on a palette color. Click on the drawing to apply the color. Save your progress and it should look like this: As you can see in the Layers Window, the Color Burn layer is fully colored in, but from the drawing, it only burned in the color onto the pencil sketch itself. This can only work when the layers are stacked accordingly. Otherwise, the color would just lay on top of the sketch layer, completely covering it. Inking \u00b6 The tools we'll use for inking are: - Pencil - Eraser - Shapes - Lines This part of the process, we'll be inking the rough sketch itself so that all the lines needed are more distinct. Create a layer in the Layers Window. Make sure this new layer is above layer \"Color Sketch\". Double-click the layer to open the Layer Properties. Rename the layer to \"Ink\". Click OK to close the window. Select \"Ink\" to make it an active layer. Use the Paint Brush tool to start inking over your rough sketches. Same as with sketching, use the Eraser tool to remove any markings not needed. Use the Shapes and Lines tools to help create your image if needed, but we will skip on the Text tool for later on. Save your progress and it should look like this: Coloring \u00b6 The tools we'll use for coloring are: - Burger image reference - Palette - Color Picker - Paint Brush - Eraser - Gradient This is now the fun part: coloring! For the purposes of this tutorial, we also added in this burger image for you to download as a color image reference for when we pick colors. Go ahead and save the image down below: Bun \u00b6 Now let's begin with the bun: Uncheck the box for the Sketch layer in the Layers Window to hide the sketch from view. We won't be needing it for this process. Create a layer in the Layers Window. Make sure this new layer is below layer \"Ink\". Double-click the layer to open the Layer Properties. Rename the layer to \"Bun Color\". Click OK to close the window. Select \"Bun Color\" to make it an active layer. Go to File > Open... and open the saved burger image reference. Use the Color Picker tool to pick the bun color from the reference and click on the project image under the Image Window to switch back to the burger project. You can create and modify your own color by double-clicking on the primary or secondary color in the Palette. Use the Paint Brush to color in the entire burger. You can enlarge the size of the Paint Brush in the Tools Settings Bar to speed up the process. Use the Eraser tool to clean up any color that was colored outside the lines. Save your progress and it should look like this: Cheese, Tomatoes & Lettuce \u00b6 We'll now work on the cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce: Create a layer in the Layers Window. Make sure this new layer is below layer \"Ink\" and above layer \"Bun Color\". Double-click the layer to open the Layer Properties. Rename the layer to \"Other Color\". Click OK to close the window. Select \"Other Color\" to make it an active layer. Using the same concept as the bun, use the Color Picker Tool to pick the colors from the reference to apply to the project for the cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce. Use the Paint Brush and Eraser tools to color in the appropriate areas. Save your progress and it should look like this: Patty \u00b6 For the patty, we want to create a gradient to replicate the over-grilled side of the patty: Create a layer in the Layers Window. Make sure this new layer is below layer \"Ink\" and above layer \"Other Color\". Double-click the layer to open the Layer Properties. Rename the layer to \"Patty Color\" and change the opacity to 90. Click OK to close the window. Select \"Patty Color\" to make it an active layer. Use the Color Picker tool to pick the patty color using from the reference image and switch back to the project. Right-click the \"Black\" color in the Palette to set the secondary color. Click on the Gradient tool. Click and hold on the drawing while dragging the cursor in different directions to form a gradient. Lift your finger once you are satisfied with the way the color is distributed. If you are not satisfied with the gradient placement, you can go back to step 9 and 10, and repeat until you are happy with the result. Use the Eraser tool to erase anything that is outside of the patty. Resize the eraser to get the required size. Double-click on the Patty Color layer and change the opacity to 100. Save your progress and the whole process should look like this: Shadows and Highlights \u00b6 This area is optional so you can skip to the next section if you want. Now let's add some dimension by adding shadows and highlights to the burger: Create a layer called \"Shadows\" and another called \"Highlights\". Make sure both layers are below layer \"Ink\" and above layer \"Patty Color\". Click on the appropriate active layer in the Layers Window to apply shadows and highlights in their respective layers. Use the Color Picker tool to pick on the bun (or cheese, tomatoes, or lettuce). Click on the primary color in the Palette and modify the color to a lighter color for highlights and darker color for shadows. Click OK to close the window. Use the Paint Brush and Eraser tool to apply color where appropriate and remove unwanted color. It is recommended to resize the two tools to a smaller size for precision. Save your progress. Adding Texts & Shapes \u00b6 The tools we'll use for adding texts and shapes are: - Shapes - Lines - Eraser Create a layer called \"Text\" and place it below layer \"Ink\". Check the box for the Sketch layer in the Layers Window to unhide the sketch. Use the Ellipse tool to create a text bubble over the sketched bubble. Use the Line tool to connect the bubble towards the burger. Repeat for the other side so it becomes a speech bubble, just like the sketch. Use the Eraser tool to erase a part of the bubble that is connected to the lines to complete the speech bubble. Click on the Text tool and in the Tools Settings Bar, modify the font to your liking. Click inside the speech bubble to create a line of text. The text can be done line by line so you will need to play around with the undo command until you position your text where you want it to be. The text can only be modified before you place it on the drawing so use the History Window to track where you want to undo and redo your actions. Uncheck the box for the Sketch layer in the Layers Window to hide the sketch from view as we will no longer need the sketch. Save your progress and it should look like this: Finished Image \u00b6 Your little secret burger is now complete! You can change the Background layer to whatever color you want. Just make sure you select it as an active layer before you begin. What we did here was apply a primary blue with secondary light-blue gradient. You can now save your image as any image file format besides .ORA and use it externally now.

Check the box for the Sketch layer in the Layers Window to unhide the sketch. Use the Ellipse tool to create a text bubble over the sketched bubble. Use the Line tool to connect the bubble towards the burger. Repeat for the other side so it becomes a speech bubble, just like the sketch. Use the Eraser tool to erase a part of the bubble that is connected to the lines to complete the speech bubble. Click on the Text tool and in the Tools Settings Bar, modify the font to your liking. Click inside the speech bubble to create a line of text. The text can be done line by line so you will need to play around with the undo command until you position your text where you want it to be. The text can only be modified before you place it on the drawing so use the History Window to track where you want to undo and redo your actions.
