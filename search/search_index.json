Its goal is to provide users with a simple yet powerful way to draw and manipulate images on Linux, Mac, and Windows. Originally created and maintained by Jonathan Pobst, until version 1.0, a new community has taken the reins to fly this program to the heights of Paint.Net and beyond! Pinta is a bitmap image editor with many features typical of image editing software including drawing tools, image filters and colour adjustment tools. The focus on usability is reflected in several of the main features of the program: Unlimited undo history. Multiple language support. Flexible toolbar arrangement, including floating as windows or docking around the image edge. Unlike some simple image editing software, Pinta also features support for image layers. About Project History Development of Pinta began in February 2010 and was driven by Jonathan Pobst, then working at Novell. In September 2011 Pobst announced that he was no longer interested in developing Pinta. A new group of developers continued the project. Pinta is written in C# and uses the GTK+ toolkit and the cairo library. The code adjustment and effect filters, originally came from Paint.NET but otherwise the project is original code. Help Contribute If you are interested in contributing to the core of Pinta, like to fix a bug or tweak existing code, you'll want to make your changes available as pull requests on GitHub. Using Git is an important part of contributing to Pinta, so if you want to read up on this we recommend reading the excellent documentation on GitHub, or if you want an even deeper understanding read Pro Git . The source code for Pinta development is available on PintaProject GitHub . Fixing a Bug If you plan to work on a bug that has been registered on our Launchpad page , then go to the relevant bug and make sure no one else is already working on it, then leave a comment saying that you are working on it. Creating a Pinta Fork First you need to make yourself an account with GitHub if you haven't already got one. It is recommended that you use your full name, because we need something to put in the credits! Then you fork the PintaProject Repository , and pull the code down to your local machine. (All explained here .) Writing, Compiling and Testing This is where the magic happens! Make whatever changes are necessary to the source code, but please do not attempt to clean up existing code. We are only interested in seeing functional changes to the code, if they are mixed with cosmetic changes it becomes very difficult to see what has actually changed. Build your code according to the building instructions , and test it to make sure it does what it's supposed to and doesn't do anything it's not supposed to. Committing your Fix When you are satisfied that you have a great fix to share with the world, commit it to your GitHub fork. (See the second part of Create A Repo .) Make sure that the commit message includes the bug number and a short description, this is vital so that the developers know what exactly they are looking at. Then it will be publicly visible for scrutiny, which comes in handy for the next step. Sending a GitHub Pull Request Pull requests are thoroughly explained here . You will want to send a pull request to the Pinta repository from your fork. When the developers see your request, they will test your solution and if it is good they will merge it into the Pinta source code. They will then close the bug on Launchpad and add your name to the credits as a contributor, and you get a lovely warm feeling inside from helping make the world a better place! Translation Another way to contribute to Pinta without writing a line of code is to translate Pinta into a new language. This is all done through a web page, so all you need to know is a second language. Pinta Translation Page Report Bugs & Feature Requests One way to contribute to Pinta without writing code is to file bugs when things don't work. Bug reports let developers know what needs to be fixed in Pinta. If you have a great idea for a new feature for Pinta, we've got a place where you can submit your ideas and vote on which ones should be implemented.

The concepts presented here are explained in much greater depth within the user guide. Everything mentioned here is easily located in the side-navigation for more specific descriptions and examples. Image Images are the basic structure used by Pinta. Roughly speaking, an \u201cimage\u201d corresponds to a single file, such as a PNG or JPEG file. You can also think of an image as corresponding to a single display window. It is not possible to have a single window display more than one image or for an image to have no window displaying it. Instead of thinking of it as a sheet of paper with a picture on it, think of it as more like a stack of papers, or in our case, a stack of \u201clayers\u201d. Layers Pinta uses layers to create a composite image. Think of layers as a stack of transparent papers. Each individual slide can contain a seperate element which will form part of the overall image. The stacked layers in Pinta are organized as if they are viewed from above. Therefore, the arrangement or order of the layers in the Layers Window is important. An opaque image on a layer higher up the stack will block or obscure the image or images in the layers lower in the stack. You can draw on each paper, but still see the content of the other sheets through the transparent areas. Intermediate users often deal with images containing many layers. Layers do not need to be opaque, and they do not cover the entire extent of an image, so when you look at an image's display, you may see more than just the top layer: you may see elements of many layers. Selection When modifying an image, you only want a part of the image to be affected. The \u201cselection\u201d mechanism makes this possible. Each image has its own selection, which you normally see as a moving dashed line separating the selected parts from the unselected parts. As with the idea of images, selections are done by layers to manipulate selected objects or areas. A large component of learning how to use Pinta effectively is acquiring the art of making good selections \u2014 selections that contain exactly what you need and nothing more. Because selection-handling is so centrally important, you can treat the selection tool as though it were a channel for color, placement, sizing, cloning, etc. Color","title":"Basic Concepts"},{"location":"concept/#basic-concepts","text":"This section provides a brief introduction to the basic concepts and terminology used in Pinta.

Pinta Workspace: Menu Bar - at the top, below the Title bar, contains drop-down menus. Toolbar - under the Menu bar, contains buttons and other elements which can be used to perform some of the more common operations. Tools Menu - in the upper-left under the Toolbar, contains a group of icons or buttons grouped together that provide you with a quick way to select commonly used functions by pointing and clicking. It works in conjunction to the Tools Preview(?) just right above it. Palette Menu - in the lower-left under the Tools Menu, provides you with quick access to a preset of colors. You can select your primary and secondary color by left-clicking or right-clicking on the color of choice. Layers Window - in the upper-right corner under the Toolbar, displays the number of layers and the active window. Layers in Pinta can be transparent, translucent, or opaque. Images Window - in the middle-right size under the Layers Window, displays the opened images that you can use as part of your layers and base image. History Window - in the lower-right corner, displays a list of commands or operations performed. Can be undone or redone by selecting a command that was performed.

This tool selects rectangle sections only. When a portion of a picture is selected tools that are used will only work in the selected area. If a square selection is needed hold the shift key when selecting the area, this will make a square selection. Move Selected Pixels - This tool is used to move, rotate and scale a selected section of the photo, or to move layers of the image made in Pinta. Lasso Select - This tool is used to hand select which sections of the image you want selected. This is done by selecting this tool and the drawing around the portion of the image you want selected while holding down the left mouse button. Move Selection - This tool is used to modify the size, rotation, and scale of what you are selecting. For example if you used to Rectangle Selection and made the rectangle too small for the area you wanted to select you can use this tool to resize and move the selection to where you want it to be. Ellipse Select - This tool works in much the same way as the Rectangle Select except it select elliptical sections (like the rectangle tool if you hold shift down it will select a circle region instead of an ellipse). Zoom - This tool is used to view the image being worked on more closely. After selecting this tool click on the section of the image you wish to view more closely. Magic Wand Select - The magic wand tool is used to select sections of the image that are similar. This tool can be adjusted to grab more or less of the image that resembles where it was used. Pan - This tool is used to move around in the image when the image is larger than the screen. To use this tool click in an area (the best area to select is somewhere in the middle of the picture) then hold down the left mouse button and move the cursor. The image will move as if you grabbed the image where you clicked and pushed or pulled the image in the direction that you moved the cursor. Paint Bucket - This tool is used to fill areas of similar color with another solid color. Gradient - This tool is used to gradients in colors as well as image fading between images. Paint Brush - This tool is used to free hand markings on the image. These markings can be made in the selected color and in a verity of sizes. Eraser - This tool is used to remove parts of an image or layer. When used on an image, or bottom layer it will leave a transparent background. When used on a layer other than the bottom one this will leave a hole in the layer that will show the underlying layer. Pencil - This tool is used to make free hand markings that are 1 pixel in size. Color Picker - This tool is used to select a color from the image you are working on. Clone Stamp - This tool is used to select a section of the picture that will be replicated into another section. This can be useful for eliminating troublesome sections that has multiple colors, patters, or textures as it will replicate those section as place them in the image. Recolor - This tool used to replace the one color with another. Text - This tool is used to add text to the image. This tool has the options to change the font with any font loaded on your computer as well as the font color. Line/Curve - This tool is used to create either straight or curved lines. In the options toolbar (located under the menu bar, is a selection for adding arrows to the begging or end of the line being created. Rectangle - This tool is used to create rectangles that can be either outlines, or filled shapes. Rounded Rectangle - This tool is similar to the rectangle tool except it creates rectangles with rounded corners.

Unlike other selection tools that select pixels based on shapes ( Lasso , Ellipse or Rectangle tools) the Magic Wand selects pixels based on color. For example you may wish to change a particular blue section or all the blue sections in an image to a different colour. The region selected may be a single continuous shape or multiple separate areas. How to Use Magic Wand Select the Magic Wand Tool from the Tool Menu options. Specify the Tolerance setting in the Tolerance bar (0-100). The higher the selected tolerance (color range), will encompass a higher relative spectrum of colors compared to the original color you click. Specify a Selection Mode in the options toolbar. You can use shortcuts to temporarily switch between them. Replace : Newly created selection cue will replace the existing one (this is the default mode) . Union : Newly selected regions will be added to the existing selection. Exclude : Clicking inside an existing selection removes an area from the selection, depending on currently set tolerance level. Xor : Selects areas around existing selection, when you click inside it. Intersect : Clicking inside an existing selection replaces it with selection under the cursor, depending on the current tolerance level. Specify under the Flood Mode one of the options ( Contiguous or Global ). Contiguous : Choose this option to select all parts of the image with the similar color that is touching the selected portion. Global : Choose this option to select all parts of the image with the similar color (within the tolerance level)regardless of whether they are touching the selected portion.
