Its goal is to provide users with a simple yet powerful way to draw and manipulate images on Linux, Mac, and Windows. Originally created and maintained by Jonathan Pobst, until version 1.0, a new community has taken the reins to fly this program to the heights of Paint.Net and beyond! Pinta is a bitmap image editor with many features typical of image editing software including drawing tools, image filters and colour adjustment tools. The focus on usability is reflected in several of the main features of the program: Unlimited undo history. Multiple language support. Flexible toolbar arrangement, including floating as windows or docking around the image edge. Unlike some simple image editing software, Pinta also features support for image layers. About \u00b6 Project History \u00b6 Development of Pinta began in February 2010 and was driven by Jonathan Pobst, then working at Novell. In September 2011 Pobst announced that he was no longer interested in developing Pinta. A new group of developers continued the project. Pinta is written in C# and uses the GTK+ toolkit and the cairo library. The code adjustment and effect filters, originally came from Paint.NET but otherwise the project is original code. Help \u00b6 Contribute \u00b6 If you are interested in contributing to the core of Pinta, like to fix a bug or tweak existing code, you'll want to make your changes available as pull requests on GitHub. Using Git is an important part of contributing to Pinta, so if you want to read up on this we recommend reading the excellent documentation on GitHub, or if you want an even deeper understanding read Pro Git . The source code for Pinta development is available on PintaProject GitHub . Fixing a Bug \u00b6 If you plan to work on a bug that has been registered on our Launchpad page , then go to the relevant bug and make sure no one else is already working on it, then leave a comment saying that you are working on it. Creating a Pinta Fork \u00b6 First you need to make yourself an account with GitHub if you haven't already got one. It is recommended that you use your full name, because we need something to put in the credits! Then you fork the PintaProject Repository , and pull the code down to your local machine. (All explained here .) Writing, Compiling and Testing \u00b6 This is where the magic happens! Make whatever changes are necessary to the source code, but please do not attempt to clean up existing code. We are only interested in seeing functional changes to the code, if they are mixed with cosmetic changes it becomes very difficult to see what has actually changed. Build your code according to the building instructions , and test it to make sure it does what it's supposed to and doesn't do anything it's not supposed to. Committing your Fix \u00b6 When you are satisfied that you have a great fix to share with the world, commit it to your GitHub fork. (See the second part of Create A Repo .) Make sure that the commit message includes the bug number and a short description, this is vital so that the developers know what exactly they are looking at. Then it will be publicly visible for scrutiny, which comes in handy for the next step. Sending a GitHub Pull Request \u00b6 Pull requests are thoroughly explained here . You will want to send a pull request to the Pinta repository from your fork. When the developers see your request, they will test your solution and if it is good they will merge it into the Pinta source code. They will then close the bug on Launchpad and add your name to the credits as a contributor, and you get a lovely warm feeling inside from helping make the world a better place! Translation \u00b6 Another way to contribute to Pinta without writing a line of code is to translate Pinta into a new language. This is all done through a web page, so all you need to know is a second language. Pinta Translation Page Report Bugs & Feature Requests \u00b6 One way to contribute to Pinta without writing code is to file bugs when things don't work. Bug reports let developers know what needs to be fixed in Pinta. If you have a great idea for a new feature for Pinta, we've got a place where you can submit your ideas and vote on which ones should be implemented.

The concepts presented here are explained in much greater depth within the user guide. Everything mentioned here is easily located in the side-navigation for more specific descriptions and examples. Image \u00b6 Images are the basic structure used by Pinta. Roughly speaking, an \u201cimage\u201d corresponds to a single file, such as a PNG or JPEG file. You can also think of an image as corresponding to a single display window. It is not possible to have a single window display more than one image or for an image to have no window displaying it. Instead of thinking of it as a sheet of paper with a picture on it, think of it as more like a stack of papers, or in our case, a stack of \u201clayers\u201d. Layers \u00b6 Pinta uses layers to create a composite image. Think of layers as a stack of transparent papers. Each individual slide can contain a seperate element which will form part of the overall image. The stacked layers in Pinta are organized as if they are viewed from above. Therefore, the arrangement or order of the layers in the Layers Window is important. An opaque image on a layer higher up the stack will block or obscure the image or images in the layers lower in the stack. You can draw on each paper, but still see the content of the other sheets through the transparent areas. Intermediate users often deal with images containing many layers. Layers do not need to be opaque, and they do not cover the entire extent of an image, so when you look at an image's display, you may see more than just the top layer: you may see elements of many layers. Selection \u00b6 When modifying an image, you only want a part of the image to be affected. The \u201cselection\u201d mechanism makes this possible. Each image has its own selection, which you normally see as a moving dashed line separating the selected parts from the unselected parts. As with the idea of images, selections are done by layers to manipulate selected objects or areas. A large component of learning how to use Pinta effectively is acquiring the art of making good selections \u2014 selections that contain exactly what you need and nothing more. Because selection-handling is so centrally important, you can treat the selection tool as though it were a channel for color, placement, sizing, cloning, etc.","title":"Basic Concepts"},{"location":"concept/#basic-concepts","text":"This section provides a brief introduction to the basic concepts and terminology used in Pinta.

Window Size (pick value between 3-100): Choose the size of the arrow head. Choosing a larger number will draw a larger arrow head(s). Angle Size : Choose an angle (between -30 to +30) for the arrow head(s). A more positive number will create a more inward angled arrow tip tail. Whereas choosing a more negative number will create a more outward angled arrow tip tall. Length : Choose a length (between -30 to +30) for the length of arrow head(s). A more positive number will create a longer arrow head. Whereas choosing a more negative number will create a more longer arrow head pointing inwards. Select a primary color from the color Palette menu. Position the cursor crosshair to the location on the screen where you want to start drawing the line/ curve. Click and hold the mouse button and move the crosshair cursor to the end of the line/curve position. Release the mouse button. To Curve the Line: Position the crosshair cursor along the line in the position you would like to extend out. Click on the position and while holding the mouse button, drag the selected point outwards to the desired shape. Release the mouse button once the desired curve is drawn. Repeat the above two steps if you would like to extend out any other curves to the line. To make modifications after a line or curve has been created: Select the Line/curve shape tool. Place and click the cursor crosshair on the line you wish to modify. A large dot will appear on the line at the location. Select and modify from the settings the brush width, dash size and arrow. Select a new primary color if you wish to change the color of the line/curve. Rectangles, Rounded Rectangles, or Ellipses \u00b6 Select the preset rectangle , rounded rectangle or ellipse shape tool. Select the desire options from the shape option menu. Brush width Dash Size : Select the top dash for a solid line otherwise select what dash pattern you would like for your line. Fill Style : Select one of the fill styles Outline Shape : Select if you only want the outline of the shape to be drawn. Fill Shape : Select if you only want the shape to be filled with a color. Fill and Outline Shape : Select if you want the shape to be outlined and filled with a color. Radius : If a preset Rounded Rectangle shape tool was chosen then the radius option menu will also appear in the top menu. Select the radius size for the corners of the rounded rectangle (the larger the value chosen the more rounded the corners will be). Select a primary color from the color Palette menu. The primary color will be used for the outline or the shape filled styles. If the Fill and Outline shape is chosen the primary color will be used for the outline and you will need to [select a secondary color]9Palette.md) to fill the inside of the shape. Position the cursor crosshair in your workspace where you would like the top left rectangle, rounded rectangle or ellipse corner to appear. Click and hold the mouse button while you then drag diagonallly the cursor from your initial position ( A ) to the right bottom corner location ( B ) of your desired rectangle,rounded rectangle or ellipse. The following images shows a pictorial representation of the direction to drag the cursor for a rectangle and an ellipse shape. Release the mouse button. Freeform Shapes \u00b6 The Freeform shape tool enables you to draw a shape that has both curved and straight segments. Select the Freeform tool from the Tools Menu. Create a starting point by clicking on the image display area with the left mouse button. Hold down the mouse button and draw the freeform shape that you wish to draw. Unlike other draw software, Pinta requires you to continuously hold down the mouse button while drawing the freeform shape which requires a very steady hand.

Contiguous : Choose this option to select all parts of the image with the similar color that is touching the selected portion.
