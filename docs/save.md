## Save Project ##

### Save vs Save As: ###
Pinta has two save options a quick save and a save as function.

To **Quick Save** you can use the (`CTRL` + `S`) shortcut or click on *Save* ![save](img/filesave.PNG) under the File menu. All images are automatically saved as JPEGs. A dialogue box will populate with a slider for JPEG Quality, with one being the lowest possible quality and 100 being the highest possible quality.

* Drag slider to the right to increase JPEG quality
* Drag slider to the left to decrease JPEG quality


For the more advanced **Save As** function, you can use the (`CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `S`) shortcut or click on *Save As...* ![save as](img/setup/saveas.png) under the File menu. An advanced dialogue box will populate where you can name the file, select file type, and select the directory.

2. Select the directory to save the project in.
3. Select "OpenRaster image (*.ora, *.ORA)" under the bottom drop-down list.
4. Click Save to save the new project.

### Exporting your project ###

Pinta allows you to export your project in a number of different formats:

Format | Extension | Use 
:-----------:|:-------------------------:|:------------
**PNG Image**| .png .PNG | lossless compression file format, good choice for storing line drawings, text, and iconic graphics at a small file size.
**BMP Image**| .bmp .BMP | an uncompressed raster image comprised of a rectangular grid of pixels, containing a file header (bitmap identifier, file size, width, height, color options, and bitmap data starting point) and bitmap pixels, each with a different color.
**ICO Image**| .ico .ICO | contains an icon, which is typically used for a Windows program, file, or folder. It stores one or more images in various sizes so they can be appropriately scaled depending on their use.
**JPEG Image**| .jpg .jpeg .JPG .JPEG | lossy compressed file format, useful for storing photographs at a smaller size than a BMP. Common choice for use on the Web because it is compressed.
**TIFF Image**| .tif .tiff .TIF .TIFF | lossless compression file format, often used for storing images with many colors, typically digital photos, and includes support for layers and multiple pages.
**TGA Image**| .tga .TGA | a file saved in the raster graphic format designed by Truevision. It supports 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits per pixel at a maximum of 24 bits for RGB colors and 8-bit alpha channel. Used for various types of images, such as digital photos and textures referenced by 3D video games.
**OpenRaster Image**| .ora .ORA | a file saved in the OpenRaster format, and open raster graphics format that supports multiple layers; supports multiple layers and contains both image data and metadata, including XMP and EXIF tags.
