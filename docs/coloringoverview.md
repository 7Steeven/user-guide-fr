![color icon](img/coloringicon.png)

Pinta's color tools and features aren't as complex as some of the more professional image editors in the market. However, you do have some flexibility to:

  -  [**Customize Color**](coloring.md): Customize the color you would like to use for your images.
  -  [**Create a Palette**](palette.md): Use the existing default Pinta palette or create your own.

  As well you have a number of different tools to color areas.

  -  [**Color Areas**](coloringarea.md): Use simple tools for coloring in objects/text/image/layer.
