### [Toolbar Features](#general-overview) ###

![toolbar](img/overview/toolbar.png)

__New__ - command allows you to create a new, blank, single layered image.

__Open__ - command allows you to open an existing image for editing.

__Save__ - command allows you to save the image with the current filename.

__Cut__ - command allows you to remove a selected portion of the active layer and place it on the clipboard. (A clipboard is a temporary storage area for data that the user wants to copy from one place to another.) 

__Copy__ - command copies the selected region to the clipboard. Unlike the Cut command, the Copy command leaves the selection on the active layer. The current selection also remains active in the active window. 

__Paste__ - command allows you to insert an image or selected section of an image from the clipboard into the active image.

__Undo__ - command allows you to erase the last change done to an image, reverting it to an older state. Notice the History Pane when you click on the Undo command. The selected item moves up the list to the previous item.

__Redo__ - command allows you to reverse your last Undo. Notice the History Pane when you click on the Redo command. The selected item moves down the list to the next item. So, the Redo command restores any actions that have been previously undone using an Undo.

__Crop to Selection__ - command is only available to a selected part of an image. To see how this feature works, click the Rectangle Select button on the Tool Palette and then select an object in your image.

__Deselect All__ - command forces all selected pixels to be deselected. After you invoke this command, you'll have no pixels in the active window selected.

__Zoom__ - command gives it the appearance of magnifying it or moving away from the image. You can use the drop-down menu to select a specific percentage zoom setting.

__Cursor Indicator__ - to show pixel coordinates where the computer cursor is located on the image.

__Selection Indicator__ - to show pixel area of the selection.

### Tools Menu Features ###

__Zoom__ - used to view the image being worked on more closely. After selecting this tool click on the section of the image you wish to view more closely.
