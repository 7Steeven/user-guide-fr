# Remove Items

 You can remove items a number of different ways using Pinta:  

 -  [**Cut**](remove_items.md#remove-item-with-cut-or-delete): Select **Cut** under the **Edit** menu to delete anything in the image that's been selected.
 -  [**Delete Key**](remove_items.md#remove-item-with-cut-or-delete): Enter `Delete` on your keyboard to delete anything that has been selected.
 -  [**Remove a Layer**](remove_items.md#remove-item-by-removing-layer): Remove a layer to delete all items on the layer. 
 -  [**Eraser**](remove_items.md#remove-item-with-eraser): Select **Eraser** to erase items from your layer.

## Remove items with Cut or Delete 

1. Select the image containing items to be removed under the **Images** window.  

     ![Image Window select image](img/crop/imageflowerselect.png)  


    &nbsp; 
 
  
2. [Select part of the image](select_overview.md) to remove using one of the selection tools.  

    The following example uses the **Rectangle Select** to select part of the image:  

    ![Cut Example](img/remove/cutwithrectangle.png)  

    &nbsp;

3. Go to **Edit** and select **Cut**. Alternatively, press `Delete` on your keyboard.

    Here's what the example image looks like after selecting **Cut** or `Delete`:

## Remove Item by Removing Layer

If you save items on separate layers, you'll only need to remove a layer to remove the items from that layer.  

The following shows an example of how this would be done.  

1. [Create a layer](layers.md) that's blank or [import a file to a layer](layers.md).


2. [Add any objects to the layer](objects.md). 
   
    ![objects added to layer](img/remove/objectsaddtolayer.png)
    &nbsp;  

3. Select the layer in the **Layers** window (it'll be selected if you just added the objects to the layer).

    ![Select Layer](img/remove/selectlayer.png)

    &nbsp;  

4. Select **Delete Layer** from the **Layers** window. 

    ![Select delete layer](img/remove/selectdeletelayer.png)

    The following shows the result of deleting layer 2 in the example above.

## Remove Item With Eraser Tool

The eraser tool is ideal for removing a very small portion of an image or to do a touch up on a photo.

1. Select **Eraser** ![Eraser](img/overview/eraser.png) from the **Tools** menu.
2. Select the desired brush width (1-55) in the *Tools Settings Bar*.
3. Click to erase and drag the **Eraser** onto the workspace to erase any part of the image, removing the item.
