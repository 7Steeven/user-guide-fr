# Remove Items

 You can remove items a number of different ways using Pinta:  

 -  [**Cut**](remove_items.md#remove-item-with-cut-or-delete): Use the cut option under the edit menu to delete anything in the image that has been selected.
 -  [**Delete Key**](remove_items.md#remove-item-with-cut-or-delete): Use the **`Delete`** key on your keyboard to delete anything that has been selected.
 -  [**Remove a Layer**](remove_items.md#remove-item-by-removing-layer): Use the remove layer method to delete all images on a layer and keep all images on other layers. 
 -  [**Eraser**](remove_items.md#remove-item-with-eraser): Use the eraser tool to erase parts of your image.

## Remove items with Cut or Delete 

1. Select from the *Images* window the image with the items that you would like to remove.

     ![Image Window select image](img/crop/imageflowerselect.png)  


    &nbsp; 
 
  
2. [Select part of an image](select_overview.md) you would like to remove using one of the selection tools.

    The following example used the rectangle selection to select part of the image:

    ![Cut Example](img/remove/cutwithrectangle.png)

    &nbsp;

3. Go to **Edit** and select **Cut**. Alternatively, select the **`Delete Key`** on your keyboard.

    ![Select cut](img/remove/cutwindow.png)


    Here is what the example image looks like after selecting **Cut** or **`Delete`**:

## Remove Item by Removing Layer

If you save items on separate layers than if you remove a layer you will remove the items on that layer from your image.

The following shows an example of how this would be done.

1. [Create a layer](layers.md) that is blank or [import a file to a layer](layers.md)


2. [Add any objects to the layer](objects.md). 
   
    ![objects added to layer](img/remove/objectsaddtolayer.png)
    &nbsp;  

3. Select the *Layer* in the **Layer** Window (it will already be selected if you just added the objects to the layer).

    ![Select Layer](img/remove/selectlayer.png)

    &nbsp;  

4. Select delete layer from the **Layer** Window. 

    ![Select delete layer](img/remove/selectdeletelayer.png)



    The following shows the result of deleting layer 2 in the example above.

## Remove Item With Eraser Tool

The eraser tool is ideal for removing a very small portion of an image or to do a touch up on a photo.

1. Select the Eraser tool ![Eraser](img/overview/eraser.png) from the **Tools** menu.
2. Select the desired brush width (1-55) in the **Eraser Tool** bar menu.
3. Left click to erase to tranparent and right click to use [secondary color](coloring.md)
4. Drag the eraser tool onto the canvas and click and drag the eraser to erase the parts of the image that you would like to remove.
