#### Auto level

The Auto-Level feature equalizes the range of colors in an image. This adjustment is used to normalize the color range of under exposed (dark) or over exposed (bright) images. It doesn’t have any configurable options, if you want to further adjust the tonal range, consider doing it manually using the levels tool. 

#### Manual level

If you aren’t satisfied with the results of the auto level adjustment, you can manually adjust:
* levels 
* brightness and contrast 
* hue and saturation.
