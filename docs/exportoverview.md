When working with Pinta you will need to export your files in a variety of file formats and printed styles. 
Pinta enables you to:

  -  [**Save Project**](save.md): Keeping a copy of the file on your computer in a file format.
  -  [**Print Project**](print.md): Although there's no print function on Pinta, if you save a file, you can print it from your device from the saved file format.
