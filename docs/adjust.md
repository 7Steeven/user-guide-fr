     -  **By absolute size**: If you know the canvas size in pixels that you want. If you choose this option you can select **Maintain the aspect ratio** to maintain the original aspect rati. You will also need to enter either the **Width** and  **Height** in pixels.  
&nbsp;  
     Note if **Maintain the aspect ratio** was chosen you only need to enter the **Width** or **Height** values, not both.  
&nbsp;  
     -  **Anchor**: Select the portion of the canvas that you want to use as a starting point before the resize transformation is done on the canvas.  
     
          You can choose from nine anchor choices. In the example below the bottom middle portion of the image was selected but you can pick any of nine anchor sections from the grid. If you want to include for example the top right hand side of the image you would select the top right anchor.
