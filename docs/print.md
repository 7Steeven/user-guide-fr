## Printing ##

Pinta itself does not have a built in printing prompt, meaning that you cannot print directly from Pinta.

If you would like to print your project: 

1. [Save](save.md) it in the appropriate format.
2. Open the newly saved file in your desired image viewing software
3. Use the **CTRL + P shortcut** or go into **File>Print** depending on the software
4. Configure the orientation, paper size, photo size, fit, and margins to your preference
5. Print the image
