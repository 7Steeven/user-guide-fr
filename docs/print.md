## Printing ##

Pinta itself does not have a built in printing prompt, meaning that you cannot print directly from Pinta.

If you would like to print your project: 

1. [Save](save.md) it in the appropriate format.
2. Open the saved file in your desired image viewing software.
3. Enter `CTRL` + `P` or go to **File** > **Print** depending on the image software.
4. Configure the orientation, paper size, photo size, fit, and margins to your preference.
5. Print the image.
