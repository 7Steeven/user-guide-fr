The **Artistic Medium** submenu is made up of Ink Sketch, Oil Painting, and Pencil Sketch, all mimicking traditional artistic mediums. 

##### Ink Sketch
The **Ink Sketch** effect makes the image appear as if it were drawn using a pen. A dialogue box populates with two sliders, ink outline and coloring.
The **Ink Outline** slider controls the weight of the outline or edging. 
*	Drag slider to the right to increase outline strength
*	Drag slider to the left to decrease outline strength

The **Coloring** slider controls how much of the original image’s color bleeds through, higher values yield higher saturation.
*	Drag slider to the right to increase color
*	Drag slider to the left to decrease color

##### Oil Painting
The **Oil Painting** effect makes the image appears as if it were painted with oil paints. A dialogue box populates with two sliders, brush size and coarseness. 

The **Brush Size** slider controls the size of the paintbrush tip, larger values yield larger strokes and smaller values yield finer strokes.
*	Drag slider to the right to increase brush size
*	Drag slider to the left to decrease brush size

The **Coarseness** slider controls how much detail is captured in the transformation. A larger value yields a more detailed oil painting render and a smaller value yields a less detailed oil painting render. 
*	Drag slider to the right to increase detail
*	Drag slider to the left to decrease detail

##### Pencil Sketch
The **Pencil Sketch** effect makes the image appear as though it were sketched with a pencil. A dialogue box populates with two sliders, pencil tip and range.

The **Pencil Tip** slider controls the sharpness of the virtual pencil. A larger value yields a blunter tip, making lines thicker and heavier. A smaller value yields a sharper tip, making lines finer, and the image appear lighter. 
*	Drag slider to the right to increase line thickness
*	Drag slider to the left to decrease line thickness


_The **Color Range** slider has no effect on the image as it’s generated in greyscale. This slider is arbitrary and can be ignored._
