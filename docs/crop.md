# **Crop**

You can remove unwanted outer areas from an image by cropping the image. There are two ways with Pinta that you can crop an image:

  - **Crop to Selection**: Use to remove part of the image surrounding the selection. The selected part of the image will expand to the size of the canvas. For irregular-shaped selection, such as those made by the **Lasso Select** tool, the image is cropped to a rectangular bounding box that contains the selection.
  - **Auto Crop** - Use this feature to remove small border areas from an image. For example, sometimes you may have a photo with a white border that you would like to remove and this feature enables you to remove it.

## **Crop to Selection** 

1. Select the image you want to crop from the **Images** window.

2. [Select part of an image you want to crop using one of the selection tools](select_overview.md).  

The following example uses the rectangle selection to select part of the image:

3. Select **Auto Crop** from the menu a number of times to reduce the amount of border on your selected image.
