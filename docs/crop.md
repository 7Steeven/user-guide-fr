# Crop

You can remove unwanted outer areas from an image by cropping an image. There are two ways with Pinta that you can crop an image:

  - Crop to Selection: Use to remove part of the image surrounding the selection. The selected part of the image will exand to the size of the canvas. For irregulary shaped selection, such as those made by the Lasso too, the image is cropped to a rectangular bounding box that contains the selection).
  - Auto Crop - Use this feature to remove small border areas from an image. For example sometimes you may have a photo with a white border that you would like to remove and this feature enables you to remove it.
