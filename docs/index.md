## __About__ ##

__*Pinta Project: Painting Made Simple*__

Pinta is a free, open-source drawing application with a versatile range of uses. It can be used as a basic graphics editor or paint tool similar to MS Paint and Paintbrush for Mac. While Pinta is not as feature rich as some pay per use software such as Photoshop, however, it does work with a design layered approach (unlike other free bitmap editors) and can be used to draw, colour and edit pictures (including digital camera photos and screenshots). For example, using a screen shot from a display, one can modify the image to include arrows pointing to specific parts of the image. 

Some of the main feature benefits of free Pinta software include: 

 -  Multiple operating system support (Linux, Windows and Mac OS X)  
 -  Layers system (most simple bitmap editors do not have this capability).  This feature is available in programs like Photoshop and GIMP but Pintaâ€™s system is more user friendly for intermediate level users. Layers help separate and group elements of an image for easy editing.  
 -  Full history (always easy to go back) enabling users to not be afraid to experiment as you can always use the undo feature.  
 -  Customizable workspace  
 -  Multiple language support  
 - Write add-ins capability ( i.e. can write a custom brush)  
 - More features than basic image drawing/photo editing packages like Paint ( Pinta has over 35 adjustments and effects for editing images) but simpler than more advanced pay-per-use software like Photoshop.
