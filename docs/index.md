## __Welcome to Pinta Project__ ##
### *Pinta: Painting Made Simple* ###

Pinta is a free, open source drawing/editing program modeled after Paint.NET. Its goal is to provide users with a simple yet powerful way to draw and manipulate images on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

Originally created and maintained by Jonathan Pobst, until version 1.0, a new community has taken the reins to fly this program to the heights of Paint.Net and beyond!

Pinta is a bitmap image editor with many features typical of image editing software including drawing tools, image filters and colour adjustment tools. The focus on usability is reflected in several of the main features of the program:

- Unlimited undo history.
- Multiple language support.
- Flexible toolbar arrangement, including floating as windows or docking around the image edge.

Unlike some simple image editing software, Pinta also features support for image layers.

### __Project History__ ###

Development of Pinta began in February 2010 and was driven by Jonathan Pobst, then working at Novell. In September 2011 Pobst announced that he was no longer interested in developing Pinta. A new group of developers continued the project.

Pinta is written in C# and uses the GTK+ toolkit and the cairo library. The code adjustment and effect filters, originally came from Paint.NET but otherwise the project is original code.
