# Selection Tools Overview
Using a *Selection Tool* you can isolate a specific area and make modifications to one or more objects within an image. You can then edit and apply effects to the selected portion of the image while leaving the unselected areas unchanged. 

Pinta provides the following *Selection Tools*:

  - [**Magic Wand**](wand.md): Use to select a colored area or similar colored areas (for example, the blue portion of an image) without having to trace an outline. You can specify the selected color range (tolerance), relative to the original color you click.
  - [**Lasso**](lasso.md):  Use to select a freeform border shaped portion of an image.
  - [**Ellipse**](ellipse.md):  Use to select an ellipse portion of an image.
  - [**Rectangle**](rectangle.md): Use to select a rectangular portion of an image.
  - [**Move Selection**](select_location.md): Use to change the selected outline location (position and orientation) that is created from one of the above selection tools.
