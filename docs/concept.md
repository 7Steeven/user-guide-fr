## __Basic Concepts__ ##

This section provides a brief introduction to the basic concepts and terminology used in Pinta. The concepts presented here are explained in much greater depth within the user guide. Everything mentioned here is easily located in the side-navigation for more specific descriptions and examples. 

### __Image__ ###

Images are the basic structure used by Pinta. Roughly speaking, an “image” corresponds to a single file, such as a PNG or JPEG file. You can also think of an image as corresponding to a single display window. It is not possible to have a single window display more than one image or for an image to have no window displaying it. 

Instead of thinking of it as a sheet of paper with a picture on it, think of it as more like a stack of papers, or in our case, a stack of “layers”.

### __Layers__ ###

Pinta uses layers to create a composite image. Think of layers as a stack of transparent papers. Each individual slide can contain a seperate element which will form part of the overall image.

The stacked layers in Pinta are organized as if they are viewed from above. Therefore, the arrangement or order of the layers in the Layers Window is important. An opaque image on a layer higher up the stack will block or obscure the image or images in the layers lower in the stack.

You can draw on each paper, but still see the content of the other sheets through the transparent areas. Intermediate users often deal with images containing many layers. Layers do not need to be opaque, and they do not cover the entire extent of an image, so when you look at an image's display, you may see more than just the top layer: you may see elements of many layers. 

### __Selection__ ###

When modifying an image, you only want a part of the image to be affected. The “selection” mechanism makes this possible. Each image has its own selection, which you normally see as a moving dashed line separating the selected parts from the unselected parts. As with the idea of images, selections are done by layers to manipulate selected objects or areas.

A large component of learning how to use Pinta effectively is acquiring the art of making good selections — selections that contain exactly what you need and nothing more. Because selection-handling is so centrally important, you can treat the selection tool as though it were a channel for color, placement, sizing, cloning, etc.
