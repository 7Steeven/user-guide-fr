#### Glow
To access the Glow effect, go to **Effects>Photo Effects>Glow**

The **Glow** effect is used to give images an inner glow by brightening lighter tones and muting color saturation, making the image appear as though it were strongly back-lit. A dialogue box populates with three sliders, radius, brightness, and contrast

The **Radius** slider controls the strength of the effect. Higher values yield stronger results.
*	Drag slider to the right to increase effect strength
*	Drag slider to the left to decrease effect strength

The **Brightness** slider controls the intensity of the illumination. Higher values yield brighter images, lower values yield darker images.
*	Drag slider to the right to increase brightness
*	Drag slider to the left to decrease brightness

The **Contrast** slider controls the color range, making an image appear more vivid or dull. Higher contract values yield more vibrant tones and lower values yield duller tones.
*	Drag slider to the right to increase contrast
*	Drag slider to the left to decrease contrast
