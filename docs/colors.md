# Improving Colors

Pinta has to options to improve color levels in an image. Poor expore, bad lighting, and various other elements can render a perfectly good photo unusable. You can use the auto level adjustment or manually adjust the image yourself to make your pictures pretty again

#### Auto level
The Auto-Level feature equalizes the range of colors in an image. This adjustment is used to normalize the color range of under exposed (dark) or over exposed (bright) images. It doesn’t have any configurable options, if you want to further adjust the tonal range, consider doing it manually using the levels tool. 

#### Manual level
If you aren’t satisfied with the results of the auto level adjustment, you can manually adjust:
* [Levels](levels.md)
* [Brightness and Contrast](BrightnessContrast.md)
* [Hue and Saturation](HueSaturation.md)
