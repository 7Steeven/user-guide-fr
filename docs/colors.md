Pinta has to options to improve color levels in an image. Poor exposure, bad lighting, and various other elements can render a perfectly good photo unusable. You can use the auto level adjustment or manually adjust the image yourself to make your pictures pretty again,


All of the color adjustment options can be found in the **Adjustments** menu:

### Auto level: ###
The Auto-Level feature equalizes the range of colors in an image. This adjustment is used to normalize the color range of under exposed (dark) or over exposed (bright) images. It doesn’t have any configurable options, if you want to further adjust the tonal range, consider doing it manually using the levels tool. 

To use **Auto Level** feature:
  1. Go to **Adustments** and select **Auto Level**. 
  
  After selecting **Auto Level** the example photo looks like the following:

### Manual level: ###

If you aren’t satisfied with the results of the auto level adjustment, you can manually adjust levels, brightness and contrast, and hue and saturation. 

#### Levels ####

Levels refers to the color or tonal range of an image. Using level adjustments, users can adjust brightness, contrast, the range of tones within an image. 
This adjustment is used to alter the color range of the image, including gamma adjustments, on a channel-by-channel basis.
The most common adjustments made using Levels include changing a picture's input and output white point, black point, and grey point.

* The white point of an image is the brightest color that appears in the image. 
* The black point is the darkest color that appears in the image.
* The grey point represents the average color across the entire image and is only found on the right-hand side (Output) of the dialog.

Each of these color points of an image may be adjusted independently using Levels.

To adjust levels:
1. Go to **Adjustments** and select **Levels**. The following Levels dialog box will appear:
