## __Setting Up Workspace__ ##

!!! Note
    If you haven't installed the program yet, please [click here](start.md) to get started.

It is recommended to invest in a drawing tablet if you want to use the program to create digital art, but using the good old-fashioned mouse is still perfectly fine to create your art as well. In this section, we'll be guiding you on setting up your workspace and understanding how to get started on creating a project (it could be editing photographs to drawing landscapes).

If you aren't familiar with the tools and the menus, we recommend to check out the [General Overview](overview.md) page to learn more and give context to the workspace.

### __Default Setup__ ###

Open the Pinta application if you haven't already, and you will see a blank workspace that looks like this:
![workspace](img/setup/workspace.png)

As you can see from the Layers Window, you have one layer called *Background*. When you want to work on an illustration or a photograph, you will need to create another layer to work on because you want to keep the background layer for any background elements that will show in your final image. To create a new layer, see *Add Layer* under Creating & Removing Layers page [here](layers.md#add-layer).

Once you have setup your new layer, you can start working on your project in that new layer or any other new layers you have created. If you need to import an image to a layer, please see *Import File into Layer* under Creating & Removing Layers page [here](layers.md#import-file-into-layer).

### __Setup with a Custom Canvas__ ###

When you open the Pinta application, it starts up with a default canvas size of 640 x 480. You can create a custom size depending on the project you are creating. For example, you want to create a banner such as this:
![canvas](img/setup/canvas.png)

You can create a new image and select the desired sizing of your canvas.

1. Click on *New...* ![new](img/setup/new.png) in the Toolbar or under the File menu.
2. Customize the canvas size using the preset or the options listed to modify the width, height, orientation, and the type of background. You can see a preview of it in the window when you are making the modifications.
3. Click OK to apply the change.

### __Setup with a Screenshot__ ###

You can create a project with a screenshot of your screen(s) as well too. If you have multiple screens, it will also capture those too, so it is recommended to use the [cropping tool](crop.md) to keep what you need.

1. Click on *New Screenshot...* ![screenshot](img/setup/screenshot.png) under the File menu
2. Customize how long of a delay you require for the capture to start.
3. Click OK to begin the countdown and it will create a canvas the size of your screen(s).
