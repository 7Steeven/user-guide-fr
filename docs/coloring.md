# Customize Colors
To add color to an object/text/image/layer you will need to select a primary and in some cases a secondary color.  

You can quickly select a color from the [color palette](palette.md) (left click on chosen color in palette to select primary and right click to select secondary) or in some cases you may want to choose a more customized color.

To select a customize color you can set the customized color by either using **Set Color Values** or **Select an Exact Color Match From an Image** methods.

## Set Color Values

1. Click on the *Primary Color* or *Secondary Color* boxes in the Palette. You can click the switch double arrow symbol to switch between the primary and secondary colors.

    -  **Hue**, **Saturation**, **Value**: Enter in the desired values. The triangle dial selector will move automatically to the corresponding values selected.
    -  **Red**, **Green**, **Blue**: Enter the RGB Color. The triangle dial selector will move then to the selected RGB value.
    -  **Opacity**: Enter in the value desired (0 - 255). The lower the number chosen the more translucent the color will be.
    -  **Color Name**: If you know the color name you want you can directly input the value. Entering in a number will change the RGB color and move the dial selector settings to the corresponding color. If the RGB color or the triangle dial selector was used to select a color this color name value will be updated.  
    -  **Eye Dropper**: Click on the eyedropper ![eye dropper](img/color/eyedropper.png) and then click a color anywhere on your screen to select that color. The corresponding color values will then be displayed on the **Choose Primary Color** or **Choose Secondary Color** dialog box.
