#### Hue/Saturation

A dialogue box with three sliders populates with one option for hue, a second option for saturation, and a third option for lightness. 
The **Hue** slider is used as a tool to correct color. The Hue slider rotates the colors used in an image as if they were on a color wheel, allowing the current palette to be cycled around. The Hue slider will only affect the colored parts of an image, it does not affect anything in black and white.

The **Saturation** slider is used to control the vibrancy of color tones in an image. The slider rests at an initial value of 100, if dragged above 100, the image becomes more vibrant, if dragged below 100, the image becomes less vibrant and dull. 
* Drag slider to the right to increase vibrancy
* Drag slider to the left to decrease vibrancy


The **Lightness** slider is very similar to the __Brightness__ adjustment, it is used to alter the exposure of an image. The slider rests at an initial value of 0, if dragged above 0 the image becomes brighter, if dragged below 0, the image looks dimmer. 
*	Drag slider to the right to increase lightness
*	Drag slider to the left to decrease lightness
The green arrow can be used to reset each slider to its original value.
