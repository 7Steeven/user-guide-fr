# Move Selection Location
Using the **Move Selection** tool, you can move and rotate the selected outline. This tool doesn't change any pixels on the active layer and only affects the location of the selected outline.

After selecting a portion of the image using the [lasso](lasso.md), [rectangle](rectangle.md), or [ellipse](ellipse.md) tools, perform the following steps:

1.  Select **Move Selection** ![Move Selection Tool](img/moveselection.png) from the **Tools** menu.

3.  Right-click the mouse button and hold while dragging the mouse around to rotate the selected outline if desired (Position **C**).

    !!! Note 
        The right-click button always controls rotation - regardless of the location of the cursor.

4.  Release the mouse button when the selected outline is in the desired location and orientation.
