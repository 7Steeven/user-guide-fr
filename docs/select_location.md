# Move Selection Location
Using the *Move Selection* Tool you can move and rotate the selected outline. This tool does not change any pixels on the active layer and only affects the location of the selected outline.

After selecting a portion of the image using the [lasso](lasso.md), [rectangle](rectangle.md) or [ellipse](ellipse.md) tools perform the following steps:

1.  Select the *Move Selection* Tool ![Move Selection Tool](img/moveselection.png) from the **Tools** Menu.
