## Remove objects from photo ##

The [**Clone Stamp**](clone.md) tool can be used to remove objects from a photo. Simply set the sample point to something next to the object and using the clone stamp brush, paint over the desired object to mask it. 

     -  Holding down CTRL, click desired part of image to set sample point
     -  Click and drag, as you would with the paintbrush tool, to paint with the cloned sample point
     -  You can adjust the size of the clone stamp brush using the brush width drop down
     -  You can turn anti-aliasing on or off depending on desired outcome, when turned on the painted edges are smooth, when off the edges appear more jagged.
