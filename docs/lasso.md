# Lasso Select
The Lasso selection tool comes in handy when you may want to select a part of an image that is not perfectly rectangular or elliptical. The Lasso selection tool can be used to draw a free-form border around a selected object within an image. 

## How to Use the Lasso 

1. Select the Lasso Tool ![lasso icon](img/lasso.png) from the Tool Menu options.

2. Position the cursor on the edge of the element that you want to select and then click and hold the mouse button.

3. Trace around the element while continuing to not release the mouse button and try to capture only what you want to retain in your selection. While you trace, a dotted line forms that follows the movement of your mouse. Continue to trace the selection and return to the starting point to close the loop.

4. Release the mouse button and Pinta will close the selection. If you did not trace fully back to your start point a straight line from your endpoint to your startpoint is generated.
