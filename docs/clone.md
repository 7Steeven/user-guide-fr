#### Clone Stamp Tool
The **Clone Stamp** tool is used to duplicate parts of an image. It sets a sample point (a region of pixels) which acts as a reference point for the new cloned area. The sample point and new cloned area can be on the same layer or different layers within the same image. This tool is ideal for duplicating objects or covering up any unwanted blemishes in an image.
•	Holding down CTRL, click desired part of image to set sample point
•	Click and drag, as you would with the paintbrush tool, to paint with the cloned sample point
•	You can adjust the size of the clone stamp brush using the brush width drop down
•	You can turn anti-aliasing on or off depending on desired outcome, when turned on the painted edges are smooth, when off the edges appear more jagged.
