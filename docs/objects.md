# Creating Simple Objects

You can draw simple objects using a number of preset shapes and freeform tools that Pinta has to offer:  

-  **Lines/Curves** 
    - [Line/curve with *Pencil* or *Paintbrush* tools](objects.md#lines-and-curves-with-the-pencil-or-brush) ![pencil](img/overview/pencil.png) ![brush](img/overview/brush.png)

## Lines and Curves

### Lines and Curves with the Pencil or Paintbrush

Before selecting a pencil or paintbrush, it's recommended to [**add a new layer**](layers.md) to the workspace so that it's easier to isolate/edit your pencil and brush strokes in the future.

1. Select [**Paintbrush** ![brush tool](img/overview/brush.png) or **Pencil** ![pencil tool](img/overview/pencil.png)](choose.md#how-to-select-a-pencil).  
2. Select a [primary color](palette.md) from the color **Palette** menu.
3. Left-click on a starting point location on the image where you would like to draw a line/curve.
4. Right-click and hold the mouse button while dragging the **Pencil** or **Paintbrush** from the starting point (A) to your desired end point (B).

### Lines and Curves With a Form Tool

The following steps explain how to draw a line using the **Line/curve** tool. After creating a straight line, you can modify it to be a curvy line and are explained below.

1. Select **Lines/Curve** ![line curve icon](img/overview/line.png) from the **Tools** menu.
2. Select the desired brush width and line style from the **Line/Curve** *Tools Settings Bar*. 
    -  **Brush width**   
        ![Brush Width](img/brushwidth.png)    
&nbsp;    
    -  **Dash Size**: Select the top dash for a solid line. Otherwise select what dash pattern you would like for your line.  
        ![Dash line](img/dash.png)    
&nbsp;  
3. Select if you would like an arrow from the **Line/curve** *Tools Settings Bar* and any other arrow options.
    -  **Arrow 1 or 2**: Click on 1 if you want a one-way arrow and on 2 for a two-way arrow. If you don't want an arrow, do not click on either of these options. If you click on one of these by mistake, you can re-click on them to deselect them.  
        ![Arrow head](img/arrow.png)    
&nbsp;    
    -  **Window Size** (pick value between 3-100): Choose the size of the arrow head. Choosing a larger number will draw a larger arrow head(s).  
        ![Window Size](img/windowsize.png)    
&nbsp;  
    -  **Angle Size**: Choose an angle (between -30 to +30) for the arrow head(s). A positive number will create a more inward angled arrow tip tail, whereas choosing a negative number will create a more outward angled arrow tip tail.  
        ![Angle Size](img/angle.png)     
&nbsp;      
    -  **Length**: Choose a length (between -30 to +30) for the length of arrow head(s). A positive number will create a longer arrow head, whereas choosing a negative number will create a longer arrow head pointing inwards.  
        ![Arrow length](img/arrowlength.png)     
&nbsp;    
4. Select a [primary color](palette.md) from the color **Palette** menu.  

5. Position the cursor crosshair to the location on the screen where you want to start drawing the line/curve.  

6. Click and hold to move the crosshair cursor to the end of the line/curve position.  
    ![line/curve first image](img/linecurveone.png) 

&nbsp;  

7. Release the mouse button.  
&nbsp;

**To Curve the Line:**  

1. Position the crosshair cursor along the line in the position you would like to extend out.  
    ![line curve](img/linecurvetwo.png)    
&nbsp;  
2. Click on the position and while holding the mouse button, drag the selected point outwards to the desired shape. Release the mouse button once the desired curve is drawn.

&nbsp; 
3. Repeat the above two steps if you would like to extend out any other curves to the line.

**To make modifications after a line or curve has been created:**  
 
1. Select **Line/Curve**.  
2. Place the cursor crosshair on the line you wish to modify and click. A large dot will appear on the line at the location.  
    ![line curve modify](img/linecurvemodify.png)    
&nbsp;  
3. Select and modify from the *Tools Settings Bar* of the brush width, dash size, and arrow.  
4. Select a new [primary color](palette.md) if you wish to change the color of the line/curve.
&nbsp;  

## Rectangles, Rounded Rectangles, or Ellipses

1. Select **Rectangle** ![rectangle icon](img/overview/rec.png), **Rounded Rectangle** ![rounded rectangle icon](img/overview/roundrec.png) or **Ellipse** ![ellipse icon](img/overview/ell.png) shape from the **Tools** menu. 
2. Select the desired options from the *Tools Settings Bar*. 
    -  **Brush width**   
        ![Brush Width](img/brushwidth.png)    
&nbsp;    
    -  **Dash Size**: Select the top dash for a solid line. Otherwise select what dash pattern you would like for your line.  
        ![Dash line](img/dash.png)    
&nbsp;   
    -  **Fill Style**: Select one of the fill styles.  
        ![Fill Style](img/Fillstyle.png)    
&nbsp;    
         -  **Outline Shape**: Select if you only want the outline of the shape to be drawn.     
         -  **Fill Shape**: Select if you only want the shape to be filled with a color.  
         -  **Fill and Outline Shape**: Select if you want the shape to be outlined and filled with a color.   
&nbsp; 
    -  **Radius**: If the **Rounded Rectangle Shape** tool was chosen, then the radius option menu will also appear in the *Tools Settings Bar*. Select the radius size for the corners of the **Rounded Rectangle** (the larger the value chosen, the more rounded the corners will be).  
        ![radius](img/radius.png)   
&nbsp;  
3. Select a [primary color](palette.md) from the color **Palette** menu. The primary color will be used for the outline or the shape-filled styles. If the *Fill* and *Outline* shape is chosen, the primary color will be used for the outline and you will need to [select a secondary color]9Palette.md) to fill the inside of the shape.  
4. Position the cursor crosshair in your workspace where you would like the top-left rectangle, rounded rectangle, or ellipse corner to appear.   
5. Click and hold the mouse button while dragging the cursor diagonallly from your initial position (**A**) to the bottom-right corner location (**B**) of your desired rectangle, rounded rectangle, or ellipse. The following images shows a pictorial representation of the direction to drag the cursor for a rectangle and an ellipse shape.    
![rectangle draw](img/drawrectangle.png)  ![ellipse draw](img/drawellipse.png)   
&nbsp;    
6. Release the mouse button.  

## Freeform Shapes
The **Freeform Shape** tool enables you to draw a shape that has both curved and straight segments.

1. Select **Freeform Shape** from the **Tools** menu.![Free Form icon](img/overview/freeform.png)  
2. Create a starting point by clicking on the image display area. 
3. Hold down the mouse button and draw the freeform shape that you wish to draw. Unlike other draw software, Pinta requires you to continuously hold down the mouse button while drawing the freeform shape which requires a very steady hand. If you are having a hard time drawing, you may wish to zoom in your screen before using the draw tool for more controlled movements.
4. Release the mouse button once you have completed drawing your desired shape. If you don't end at your starting point (**A**), Pinta will default to drawing a straight line between the end point (**B**) and start point of the closed shape (refer to Draw Freeform Shape Example diagram below).
