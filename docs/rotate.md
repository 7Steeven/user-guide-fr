# Rotate

 You can rotate an image by using:  

 -  [**Rotate Image Preset Degrees**](rotate.md#rotate_image_preset_degrees): Use to rotate an image by 90 or 180 degrees.
 -  [**Rotate Layer Specified Degrees**](rotate.md#rotate_layer_specified_degrees): Use to rotate a layer by a specific degree.
 -  [**Rotate using Move Selection Tool**](move.md): Use this to move a selected portion of an image. 

## Rotate Image Preset Degrees

1. Select the image you want to rotate from the **Images** window.  

     ![Image Window select image](img/selectimage.png)  
    &nbsp;  
  
2. Go to **Image** menu and select one of the preset rotations.

     ![Image Window select image](img/imagerotateselect.png)  

    - **Rotate 90 degrees Clockwise**
    - **Rotate 90 degrees Counter-Clockwise**
    - **Rotate 180 degrees**    
&nbsp;

    The following example shows what would happen if **Rotate 90 degrees Clockwise** was selected:

    ![Rotate ninety degrees](img/imagerotate.png)  

3. Check that the image has rotated after selecting a preset rotation. If you'd like to unrotate the image, use the [undo function](concept.md). 

## Rotate Layer Specified Degrees

1.  Select the layer that you would like to rotate from the **Layers** window.

     ![Layer Window select layer](img/selectlayer.png)  


    &nbsp; 
 
  
2. Go to **Layers** menu and select **Rotate / Zoom Layer**.

     ![Layer Properties Select](img/layerrotatemenu.png)  

     The **Rotate / Zoom Layer** dialog box will appear on your screen.  
     
     ![Rotate/Zoom Layer menu](img/rotatezoomlayerdialog.png)
     &nbsp;

3. From the **Rotate / Zoom Layer** dialog box:  
    1. Select the level of degree that you'd like to rotate the layer by the following methods:
        -  Select the dial stick and drag it to move the dial stick until you set the desired degree.
        -  Enter in the degree number setting directly in the degree box by typing in the degree value.
        -  Enter in the degree number by using the up and down arrows of the degree box.

    2. Click **OK** when the degree amount is the desired value.  

    The following example shows what would happen if Rotate 127 degrees was selected:  

      ![Rotate one hundred twenty seven degrees](img/rotatelarge.png)
    
##  Rotate Using The Move Selection Tool

If you only want to rotate a portion of an image, you can use the *Move Selected Pixels* tool.
