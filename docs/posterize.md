#### Posterize
The **Posterize** adjustment reduces the number of color values that each pixel uses, giving the image a “posterized” effect. A dialogue box with 3 sliders, one for red, one for green, and one for blue will appear. Each RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color channel has 256 possible values, the sliders let you adjust the range from 2 to 64. The lower the number, the less color value each pixel uses.
*	If the ☐ Linked checkbox is unchecked, you can adjust each color channel independently
*	If the ☑ Linked checkbox is checked, all color channels will follow the same value
