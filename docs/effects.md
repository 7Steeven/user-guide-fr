### Glow: ###
To access the Glow effect, go to **Effects>Photo Effects>Glow**

The **Glow** effect is used to give images an inner glow by brightening lighter tones and muting color saturation, making the image appear as though it were strongly back-lit. A dialogue box populates with three sliders, radius, brightness, and contrast

The **Radius** slider controls the strength of the effect. Higher values yield stronger results.

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase effect strength
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease effect strength

The **Brightness** slider controls the intensity of the illumination. Higher values yield brighter images, lower values yield darker images.

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase brightness
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease brightness

The **Contrast** slider controls the color range, making an image appear more vivid or dull. Higher contract values yield more vibrant tones and lower values yield duller tones.

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase contrast
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease contrast



### Sharpen: ###
To access the Sharpen effect go, to **Effects>Photo Effects>Sharpen**

![kfcsharpen](img/kfcsharpen.png)

The **Sharpen** effect is used to reduce softness and emphasize texture in an image to draw in viewer focus. A dialogue box populates with a strength slider. The strength slider controls how pronounced the edges in an image appear, increasing the contrast of edges.

![sharpenbox](img/sharpenbox.png)

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase sharpness
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease sharpness

### Soften Portrait: ###

To access the Soften Portrait effect go, to **Effects>Photo Effects>Soften Portrait**

The **Soften Portrait** effect is used to soften images as if the lighting were diffused, adding a subtle glow. A dialogue box populates with three sliders, softness, lighting, and warmth.

The **Softness** slider controls the strength of the effect. Higher values yield a softer, more blurred image. 

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase softness
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease softness

The **Lighting** slider controls the strength of the illumination. Higher values yield stronger lighting and brighter images. 

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase lighting
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease lighting
 

The **Warmth** slider controls the color of the lighting. Higher values yield more warmth, making tones appear more golden. Lower values yield more coolness, making tones appear bluer.

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase warmth
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease warmth

### Blur: ###

The **Blur** submenu is made up of six blurring options: fragment, gaussian, motion, radial, unfocus, and zoom. These can be applied to the whole image or a selected area.

#### Fragment ####

![kfcfragmentblur](img/kfcfragmentblur.png)

The **Fragment Blur** effect superimposes copies or “fragments” of the image or selected area. copies or "fragments" of the image are superimposed over the original. This blur can be useful when creating an unfocussed multi-viewed version of an image. The effect is not unlike modern interpretations of insect-like vision and could be used to fake "drunken" or "semi-conscious" vision. A dialogue box populates with three sliders for fragments, distance, and rotation.

![fragmentblurbox](img/fragmentblurbox.png)

The **Fragments** slider controls how many fragments appear. A higher value yields more fragments.

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase number of fragments
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease number of fragments
     
The **Distance** slider controls how close or far fragments appear from one another. A higher value yields more distance between fragments.

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase distance
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease distance
     
The **Rotation** circle slider controls the angle at which the fragments sit. It can be rotated 360 degrees. 

#### Gaussian ###

![kfcgaussianblur](img/kfcgaussianblur.png)

The **Gaussian Blur** effect applies a defocusing blur to the image or selected area. A dialogue box populates with one slider for radius.

![gaussianblurbox](img/gaussianblurbox.png)

The **Radius** slider controls how widely and how strongly the blur is applied. A higher value yields a stronger effect.

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase blur strength
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease blur strength

#### Motion ####

![kfcmotionblur](img/kfcmotionblur.png)

The **Motion Blur** effect creates the illusion of motion in an image or selected area. A dialogue box populates with two sliders, for angle and distance.

![motionblurbox](img/motionblurbox.png)

The **Angle** circle slider controls the angle at which the motion blur appears It can be rotated 360 degrees.

The **Distance** slider controls the width of the blur, how far the effect shifts the original pixels. A higher value yields a wider effect.

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase motion blur effect
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease motion blur effect. 



#### Radial ####

![kfcradialblur](img/kfcradialblur.png)

The **Radial Blur** effect is like the motion blur, but rather than following a linear path, it follows a circular one. A dialogue box populates with configurable options for angle, offset, and quality. 

![radialblurbox](img/radialblurbox.png)

The **Angle** circle slider controls the angle at which the blur appears It can be rotated 360 degrees.

The **Center** option box is used to configure where the effect will be interpreted from, setting the focus or center of the blur. 

The **Quality** slider is used to define the quality of the blur. A higher value yields higher quality. It is recommended to use low quality for previews, small images, and small angles. High quality should be used for final quality, large images, and large angles. 

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase quality
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease quality 

#### Unfocus ####

![kfcunfocusblur](img/kfcunfocusblur.png)

The **Unfocus Blur** effect is like the Gaussian blur but yields a more dreamy or unfocused look to the image or selected area. A dialogue box populates with a slider for radius.

![unfocusblurbox](img/unfocusblurbox.png)

The **Radius** slider controls the strength of the effect. A higher value yields a stronger blur effect. 

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase blur strength
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease blur strength  

#### Zoom ####

![kfczoomblur](img/kfczoomblur.png)

The **Zoom Blur** effect is used to give the appearance of motion towards the focal point of an image, as if the viewer were closing in on the focal point. It is like the Motion blur but applied outwards from a central point. A dialogue box populated with two configurable options, amount and offset.

![zoomblurbox](img/zoomblurbox.png)

The **Amount** slider controls how strong the blur appears. A higher value yields a stronger effect. 

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase blur strength
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease blur strength  

The **Offset** option box is used to configure where the effect will be interpreted from, setting the focus or center of the blur. 


### Distort: ###


### Artistic Medium: ###

The **Artistic Medium** submenu is made up of Ink Sketch, Oil Painting, and Pencil Sketch, all mimicking traditional artistic mediums. 

##### Ink Sketch ####

![inksketch](img/kfcinksketch.png)

The **Ink Sketch** effect makes the image appear as if it were drawn using a pen. A dialogue box populates with two sliders, ink outline and coloring.

![inksketchbox](img/inksketchbox.png)

The **Ink Outline** slider controls the weight of the outline or edging. 

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase outline strength
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease outline strength

The **Coloring** slider controls how much of the original image’s color bleeds through, higher values yield higher saturation.

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase color
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease color

##### Oil Painting ####

![kfcoilpainting](img/kfcoilpainting.png)

The **Oil Painting** effect makes the image appears as if it were painted with oil paints. A dialogue box populates with two sliders,
brush size and coarseness. 

![oilpaintingbox](img/oilpaintingbox.png)

The **Brush Size** slider controls the size of the paintbrush tip, larger values yield larger strokes and smaller values yield finer strokes.

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase brush size
     -    Drag slider to the left to decrease brush size

The **Coarseness** slider controls how much detail is captured in the transformation. A larger value yields a more detailed oil painting render and a smaller value yields a less detailed oil painting render. 

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase detail
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease detail

##### Pencil Sketch ####

![kfcpencilsketch](img/kfcpencilsketch.png)

![pencilsketchbox](img/pencilsketchbox.png)

The **Pencil Tip** slider controls the sharpness of the virtual pencil. A larger value yields a blunter tip, making lines thicker and heavier. A smaller value yields a sharper tip, making lines finer, and the image appear lighter. 

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase line thickness
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease line thickness


_The **Color Range** slider has no effect on the image as it’s generated in greyscale. This slider is arbitrary and can be ignored._ 


### Render: ###

The **Render** submenu is made up of Clouds, Julia Fractal, and Mandelbrot Fractal, these three effects create completely new renderings, replacing all color information in the active layer or selection. 

##### Clouds ####

![cloudrender](img/cloudrender.png)

The **Clouds** effect renders a randomized cloud pattern to the layer or desired selection. A dialogue box with two sliders, for scale and power, and a dropdown selection for blend mode will populate.

![cloudbox](img/cloudbox.png)

The **Scale** slider controls the size of clouds. Higher values yield larger clouds and lower values yield finer clouds. 

     -   Drag slider to the right to increase cloud size
     -   Drag slider to the left to decrease cloud size

The **Power** slider controls how coarse or how fluffy the clouds appear, dealing with their texture. Higher values yield coarser, more detailed clouds and lower values yield softer, more blurred clouds.

     -   Drag slider to the right to increase cloud texture
     -   Drag slider to the left to decrease cloud texture

The **Blend Mode** dropdown menu lets you decide how the rendered clouds will be blended with the original image or layer.

Name    | Description |
:-----------:|:-------------------------:| 
 **Normal**   | This is the default and standard blend mode. Each pixel in the layer is blended with the composition depending on its alpha value. |   
 **Multiply** |  Each pixel's RGB component intensity is   multiplied with the pixel value from the composition. The result of this   blend mode is always darker than the original.  White pixels in the   blend layer are effectively rendered transparent by the Multiply blend. |  
 **Additive** |    Each pixel's RGB component intensity is   added to the intensity of the pixel values from the composition.  The Additive blend   has the effect of brightening pixels in the final composition. Black   pixels in the blend layer are rendered as transparent by the Additive blend.   |
 **Color Burn** |    This blend mode has the effect of making   dark pixels darker while lighter pixels must be blended with other light   colored pixels in order to remain bright.    |       
 **Color Dodge**  |    This can be thought of as the opposite   of Color   Burn. Lighter pixels retain their brightness while darker   pixels must be blended with other dark pixels in order to remain dark.|
 **Reflect**   |    This blend mode can be used for adding   shiny objects or areas of light. Black pixels in the blend layer are   ignored as if they were transparent.          |
 **Glow**          |    This is the reverse of the Reflect mode:   it works the same as swapping the layer positions and using Reflect.   Glow effectively   brightens the composition by the amount of brightness in the blend   layer.  Black pixels in the blend layer are rendered as if they were   transparent.|
**Overlay**    |    This is a combination of Screen and Multiply modes   which uses the blend pixel intensity to determine the result.  For   darker colors, this acts like Multiply. For   lighter colors, this acts like Screen.|
  **Difference** |    The counterpart to Additive blending. The   layer pixel's intensity is subtracted from the composition pixel's intensity   resulting in darker colors.  Subtraction could produce a negative   intensity which is unable to be displayed, so an absolute value is   returned.  Thus, both "white minus black" and "black   minus white" will both produce white. Difference blend   is often useful when using the Clouds effect.    |
  **Negation**   |    At first glance this seems similar to Difference,   however it actually produces the opposite effect.  Instead of making   colors darker, it will make them brighter.   |
 **Lighten**     |    The lightest pixel of either the blend   layer or the composition is used.  |
  **Darken**     |    The darkest pixel of either the blend layer or the composition is used. |
  **Screen**  |    This can be thought of as the opposite of the Multiply blend mode. It is used to make pixels brighter, with black being effectively transparent. |
 **Xor**  |    This is short for "exclusive   OR", which is an advanced blending mode that is primarily used for image analysis.  Pixels in the blend layer which exactly match the composition   will be rendered black. Where differences exist, colors are shown. |


The **Reseed** button randomizes the cloud pattern. 

The **Coloring** of the rendered clouds depends on the two colors selected in the color palette. To render clouds as a single color, lower the secondary color’s opacity to 0 in the color selection menu. 

#### Julia Fractal ####

![juliafractalrender](img/juliafractalrender.png)

The **Julia Fractal** effect renders a Julia Fractal on the layer or desired selection. A dialogue box with four sliders, for factor, quality, zoom, and angle will populate. The colors of this fractal are not configurable.

![juliafractalbox](img/juliafractalbox.png)

The **Factor** slider controls the color saturation. Higher values yield more vivid colors and lower values yield duller colors, with 1 rendering a greyscale fractal. 

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase saturation
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease saturation

The **Quality** slider controls the amount of detail in the fractal. Higher values yield a smoother, more detailed fractal and lower values yield a more jagged, “pixelated” fractal. 

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase fractal detail
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease fractal detail

The **Zoom** slider controls the scale, allowing you to zoom in or out. 

     -  	Drag slider to the right to zoom in
     -  Drag slider to the left to zoom out

The **Angle** circle slider controls the angle at which the fractal sits. It can be rotated 360 degrees. 

#### Mandelbrot Fractal ####

![mandelbrotfractalrender](img/mandelbrotfractalrender.png)

The **Mandelbrot Fractal** effect renders a Mandelbrot Fractal on the layer or desired selection. A dialogue box with four sliders, for factor, quality, zoom, and angle will populate. 

![mandebrotfractalbox](img/mandelbrotfractalbox.png)

The colors of this fractal are not configurable but can be inverted. Checking the ☑ Invert Colors checkbox has the same effect as applying **Adjustments > Invert Colors.** 
 
The **Factor** slider controls the color saturation. Higher values yield more vivid colors and lower values yield duller colors, with 1 rendering a greyscale fractal. 

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase saturation
     -  	Drag slider to the left to decrease saturation

The **Quality** slider controls the amount of detail in the fractal. Higher values yield a smoother, more detailed fractal and lower values yield a more jagged, “pixelated” fractal. 

     -  	Drag slider to the right to increase fractal detail
     -    Drag slider to the left to decrease fractal detail

The **Zoom** slider controls the scale, allowing you to zoom in or out. 

     -  	Drag slider to the right to zoom in
     -  	Drag slider to the left to zoom out

The **Angle** circle slider controls the angle at which the fractal sits. It can be rotated 360 degrees.
