### Glow: ###

![kfcglow](img/kfcglow.PNG)

The **Glow** effect is used to give images an inner glow by brightening lighter tones and muting color saturation, making the image appear as though it were strongly back-lit. A dialog box populates with three sliders, radius, brightness, and contrast.

1. Go to **Effects** > **Photo** and select **Glow**. The **Glow** dialogue box will then appear.

    ![glowbox](img/glowbox.PNG)


2. Adjust the **Radius** slider to control the strength of the effect. Higher values yield stronger effect results.

   * Drag slider to the right to increase effect strength
   * Drag slider to the left to decrease effect strength

3. Adjust the **Brightness** slider to control the intensity of the illumination. Higher values yield brighter images, lower values yield darker images.

   * Drag slider to the right to increase brightness
   * Drag slider to the left to decrease brightness

4. Adjust the **Contrast** slider to control the color range, making an image appear more vivid or dull. Higher contrast values yield more vibrant tones and lower values yield duller tones.

### Blur: ###

There are six **Blur** effect options: [**Fragment**](effects.md#fragment), [**Gaussian**](effects.md#gaussian), [**Motion**](effects.md#motion), [**Radial**](effects.md#radial), [**Unfocus**](effects.md#unfocus), and [**Zoom**](effects.md#zoom). These can be applied to the whole image or a selected area.

#### Fragment ####

The **Fragment** blur effect superimposes copies or “fragments” of the image or selected area. Copies or "fragments" of the image are superimposed over the original. This blur can be useful when creating an unfocussed multi-viewed version of an image. The effect is not unlike modern interpretations of insect-like vision and could be used to fake "drunken" or "semi-conscious" vision.
